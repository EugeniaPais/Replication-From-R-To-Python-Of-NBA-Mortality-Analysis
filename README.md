# Replication from R to Python of NBA  mortality analysis

The code was developed as part of an academic project, serving as a Python-based replication of the work detailed in the following article (originally implemented with R): "Jose A. Martínez, Klaus Langohr, Julián Felipo, Luciano Consuegra, Martí Casals, Data set on mortality of national basketball association (NBA) players, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108615](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922008216#bib0002:~:text=https%3A//doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108615)
Data in Brief, Volume 45, 2022,108615,ISSN 2352-3409.
"

The purpose of this code replication is to generate methods or code that help address the problem using Python, such as the ageadjust_indirect method. This method is part of an R library, but there was no equivalent in Python at the time of replication
